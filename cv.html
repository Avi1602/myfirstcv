            <h5>Hello! My name is Abhishek Gupta, and I'm delighted to share a glimpse into my academic journey as a student
                pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science. As a passionate learner deeply immersed in
                the realm of technology, I have devoted my studies to the fascinating domain of Internet of Things (IoT).
                Currently navigating through my 6th semester, each step of my educational expedition has been marked by a
                profound exploration of diverse subjects, providing me with a rich tapestry of knowledge and experiences.
    
                My fascination with technology ignited my pursuit of a specialized focus in IoT within the vast landscape of
                Computer Science. This field, which seamlessly integrates the physical and digital worlds through
                interconnected devices and sensors, has captivated my interest due to its immense potential to revolutionize
                industries and enhance daily living. Through my coursework and practical projects, I have delved deep into
                understanding the intricacies of IoT architecture, protocols, and applications, allowing me to harness its
                transformative power effectively.
                </br>
                Throughout my academic odyssey, I have embarked on an exhilarating exploration of various subjects that form
                the cornerstone of computer science education. From the intricate algorithms governing computational
                processes to the elegant design principles of software engineering, each facet of my curriculum has provided
                me with invaluable insights and skills essential for navigating the dynamic landscape of technology.
                The study of algorithms and data structures has been particularly enlightening, equipping me with the
                analytical prowess and problem-solving abilities necessary for tackling complex computational challenges.
                Understanding the fundamental building blocks of algorithms has not only honed my logical reasoning but has
                also empowered me to devise efficient solutions to real-world problems.

                    <h4>DocLock – Documentation Locker Using Blockchain</h4>
                    <p>Motivation: The concept of "Doclock," utilizing blockchain technology, aims to secure and
                        authenticate documents. Blockchain, a
                        decentralized and distributed ledger, ensures transparency, immutability, and data security.
                        Motivations for implementing a
                        Doclock system using blockchain include:
                        <br>1. Immutability: Blockchain provides a tamper-proof record; once a document is added, it cannot
                        be altered, ensuring
                        longterm integrity.
                        <br>2. Decentralization: Operating on a decentralized network, blockchain eliminates the need for a
                        central authority, enhancing
                        reliability and reducing the risk of manipulation.
                        <br>3. Security: Utilizing cryptographic techniques, blockchain ensures data security, crucial for
                        sensitive documents like legal
                        contracts, medical records, and intellectual property.
